Shambhala is a steel hypercoaster roller coaster located at PortAventura Park in Salou and Vilaseca, Spain.
Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, it was the tallest (76 metres (249 ft)) and second fastest (134 kilometres per hour (83 mph)) coaster in Europe at the time of its opening.

The height and speed records were beaten in April 2017 by Red Force (with a height of 112 metres (367 ft)), which was also opened in PortAventura World in its new theme park Ferrari Land.
Among coasters with a lift hill, the height and speed records were beaten in July 2018, when Hyperion opened at Energylandia in Poland.

Shambhala is named and themed after the inaccessible land in the Himalayas: Shambhala.
The coaster was announced on 24 October 2011, and opened to the public on 12 May 2012.

The minimum height to enter the Shambala ride (height restriction) is 140 cm.
