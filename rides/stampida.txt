Stampida is a racing, wooden roller coaster built by Custom Coasters International at PortAventura Park in the resort PortAventura World, Salou, Catalonia, Spain.

It is a very rickety roller coaster with many drops and 2 tunnels.
It features two parallel tracks with blue and red cars each one, but then they run separately for a while.
Finally, they come parallel again to the end of the ride.

It shares a part of its route with a kiddie wooden roller coaster named Tomahawk.

The minimum height to enter the Stampida ride (height restriction) is 120 cm.
