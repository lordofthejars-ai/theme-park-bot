Tonnes of Aztec gold, a thousand traps that protect it, and many treasure hunters fighting to get it in a dark ride full of excitement and fun.

Its track is the perfect combination of side launches, rotating platforms, inverted free falls and amazing animation.
673 whirlwind and rapid-fire metres inside PortAventura World’s most mysterious mountain.
